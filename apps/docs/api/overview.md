# Aglyn REST API

The Aglyn REST API gives you programmatic access to your organization's data —
[datasets and records](resources/datasets.md), [contacts](resources/contacts.md),
[sites](resources/sites.md), and form submissions. Use it to sync content from
another system, back up records, or build an integration.

:::info Plan availability
The REST API is included on the **Business** plan. Create keys from
**Organization → Settings → API keys**.
