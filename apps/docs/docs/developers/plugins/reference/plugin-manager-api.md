# Plugin-manager API reference

Everything a plugin registers goes through `libs/aglyn/src/lib/plugin-manager`,
re-exported from **`@aglyn/aglyn`** (client + isomorphic) and
**`@aglyn/aglyn/server`** (adds the server-only loaders). Hand-written by
design: the surface is small and curated, and each entry needs semantics
(ordering, caching, failure behavior) that generated signatures can't carry.

## Console extensions — `feature-plugins`

| API | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `registerConsoleExtension(extension)` | Declares everything a plugin adds to the console shell. Idempotent by `pluginId` (re-registration replaces). |
| `listConsoleNavItems()` / `resolveConsolePluginPage(href)` | How the shell renders nav + serves plugin pages under `/[hostId]/[pluginSlug]`. |
| `listConsoleWidgets(slot)` | Widgets registered for a named zone — see [Injection zones](injection-zones.md). |
| `listConsoleProviders()` | App-level providers mounted around every console page. |
| `defineUiFeatureBundle(options, components)` | Site/canvas component bundle; auto-depends on the base `mui` bundle. Component and bundle ids are **persisted in screen docs — never rename**. |
| `CONSOLE_WIDGET_SLOTS` | The typed injection-zone catalog. |

`ConsoleExtension` fields: `pluginId`, `displayName`, `featureFlag?`
(plan-entitlement gate the shell applies — extensions cannot bypass plans),
`navItems?` (a nav item with a `Component` becomes a full page and receives
`ConsolePluginPageProps { hostId, entitled, org?, permissions? }`),
`dashboardCards?`, `settingsSections?`, `widgets?`, `providers?`.

## Loading — `plugin-loader`

| API | Semantics |
| --- | --- |
| `createPluginLoader(manifest)` | One loader per generated manifest; loads are cached per plugin, registrations once per plugin+surface. |
| `loader.ensure(ids, surfaces)` | Loads + registers the given plugins' surfaces. Returns a **stable promise per (ids, surfaces)** so React `use()` can suspend on it during SSR — the canvas never renders against an empty registry. Unknown ids are ignored (marketplace realm plugins load separately); `alwaysOn` entries activate regardless. |
| `loader.ensureAll(surfaces)` | Every manifest plugin — the API dispatchers' lazy-load-all. |
| `loader.pluginIdForApiPath(path)` | Prefix-map fallback for the per-request org gate. |

**Lifecycle**: all `register` fns in an ensure batch run first, then each
module's optional **`bootstrap<Surface>()`** export runs (manifest order,
once per plugin+surface, failures logged not fatal) — the sanctioned place
for cross-plugin wiring. Plugins loaded by a later ensure bootstrap in that
batch, so read registries lazily rather than snapshotting.

## Server APIs — `api-plugins` (`/server` only)

| API | Semantics |
| --- | --- |
| `registerPluginApiRoute(path, handler)` | Registers an exact path under the `[...pluginApi]` dispatchers. Ownership is recorded at registration time for the per-request org gate — a disabled plugin's paths 404 for that workspace. |
| `PluginApiRequest` | `{ method, query, body, headers, rawBody? }` — `rawBody` carries the unparsed payload for Stripe/Svix signature verification. |

## Site pipeline — `site-runtime`, `site-page-hooks` (`/server` for hooks)

| API | Semantics |
| --- | --- |
| `registerSiteRuntime({runtimeId, Component})` | Components rendered on every published page (overlay engines, experiment runners); they read back the props their server enricher wrote. |
| `registerSiteRedirectResolver(fn)` | Runs before route resolution; first non-null redirect wins. |
| `registerSitePageResolver(fn)` | Composes plugin-owned pages (commerce PDP/PLP). |
| `registerSitePageEnricher(fn)` | Contributes page-prop slices; **enricher errors are isolated** — a broken plugin drops its slice, never the page. |

## Billing — `billing-webhook-hooks` (`/server`)

`registerBillingWebhookHandler(eventTypePrefix, handler)` — receives the
platform Stripe events. **Handler errors propagate to a 500 so Stripe
redelivers**; make handlers idempotent.

## Enablement, flags, config, fields, permissions, jobs

| API | Semantics |
| --- | --- |
| `resolveEnabledPlugins(org)` | The org switchboard: absent field → all first-party; always-on unioned in; unknown (marketplace) ids kept. |
| `filterPluginsByReleaseFlags(ids, isFlagOn, {staffBypass})` | Subtracts release-flagged-off first-party plugins (AGL-422). |
| `registerPluginConfigSchema(schema)` / `mergePluginConfig` / `validatePluginConfigValues` | Per-plugin settings: declared once, generic form + typed defaults-merged reads everywhere (AGL-428). |
| `registerCustomFieldType(fieldType)` / `validateCustomFieldValue` | Dataset field types riding existing storage types (AGL-434). |
| `registerPluginPermissions(list)` | Role-resolved permission keys with per-tier defaults (AGL-435). |
| `registerPluginJob(job)` / `runPluginJobs(due?)` | Scheduled jobs run by the guarded `/api/plugins/run-jobs` route (AGL-435). |
| `registerPluginInstallPresetMapper(fn)` | Maps marketplace install docs to besigner drawer presets. |

## Remote bundles — `realm-plugins` (isomorphic), `realm-server` (`/server`)

| API | Semantics |
| --- | --- |
| `PLUGIN_HOST_ABI_VERSION` / `setRealmPluginHost(host)` | The `__AGLYN_PLUGIN_HOST__` ABI slot; **the app composes it** from its own React/jsxRuntime/registry singletons. |
| `verifyRealmBundle(bytes, install, publicKey?)` | sha256 pin always; Ed25519 signature mandatory when a key is configured (fails closed). |
| `loadRealmPlugins(installs, {artifactsBase, publicKeyBase64})` | Fetch → verify → blob-URL import → `register(host)`. Cached per listing@version; ABI mismatches refused; per-bundle failures logged and skipped. |
| `loadRemoteServerBundles(source)` | Env-gated server tier (default OFF); returns what loaded so callers can audit. |
| `isCompatibleHostAbi(hostAbi?)` | The ABI gate: undeclared = legacy (allowed with a warning). |

## Sandbox — `plugin-bridge`

The versioned postMessage protocol between the host `PluginFrame` and a
sandboxed bundle: `parseGuestMessage` (origin/source/schema-validated),
`filterPluginProps` (manifest allowlist), message types `ready`/`init`/
`props`/`resize`/`event`/`fetch-request`/`fetch-response`/`error`. The
bridge never evals or grafts anything from the frame — sized output and
named events only; network goes through the host-mediated fetch
(server-side allowlist re-check).
