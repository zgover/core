# Plugins & Marketplace

**Plugins** extend Aglyn with new components and capabilities. You install them from the
**community marketplace**, configure them per host, and they run **sandboxed** so they can't
compromise your site.

:::info Plan availability
**Free** to install community plugins; some plugins and marketplace monetization features
are paid.
:::

## Install & upgrade

- Browse the **plugin registry** and install a plugin.
- Installs are **version-pinned**, and you can **upgrade** deliberately.
- Installed plugins appear as named entries in the Besigner **drawer**, alongside built-in
  components.

## How plugins run

- Each plugin loads into a **sandboxed PluginFrame** host runtime, isolated by origin.
- A **manifest + sandbox bridge protocol** defines what a plugin can do.
- A **host-mediated network bridge** lets plugins make network calls without direct access
  to your environment.

## Configure

Plugins expose a **settings** field for per-plugin configuration, so the same plugin can
behave differently on each host.

## Publish your own

The **publish + install pipeline** lets developers ship plugins to the marketplace with
version pinning. The community marketplace also supports **paid listings**, Stripe Connect
payouts, and a publisher **ledger**.
