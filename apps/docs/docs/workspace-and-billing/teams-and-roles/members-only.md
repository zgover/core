# Members-only areas

Beyond your team, your **site visitors** can become **members** — and you can restrict
certain screens to signed-in members only.

:::info Plan availability
**Business** and above. Members-only screens, gated video, and the content
paywall need the content-gating feature; on lower plans (or if a
subscription lapses) gated content is not served.

## Let visitors sign up

Enable site **membership** so visitors can **sign in / sign up** to your site. New members
flow into your [Contacts CRM](../../content-and-data/contacts/overview.md) automatically.

## Sign-in, sign-up, and recovery pages

Every site serves three membership routes out of the box:

- **`/signin`** — email + password sign-in
- **`/signup`** — create an account
- **`/recover`** — forgotten-password recovery

By default these render simple built-in forms styled with your site theme. To make them
fully yours, **design them in the besigner** like any other screen:

1. Create a screen and drop in the matching block from the **Members** group of the
   element picker — **Member sign-in**, **Member sign-up**, or **Password recovery**.
   Add anything else you like around it: your logo, imagery, copy.
2. Open **Setup → Basic details → Sign-in & sign-up pages** and assign the screen to
   its route.

Assigned screens render through the normal pipeline — your theme, shared layout, and
all — and are kept out of search results. Clearing a slot falls back to the built-in
form.

:::tip Send members back where they came from
The sign-in and sign-up blocks honor a `continue` query parameter
(e.g. `/signin?continue=/members/welcome`), so links from gated pages can return
the visitor to the page they wanted. Only same-site paths are followed.

### Forgotten passwords

Members who forget their password can request a reset from the **Forgot password?**
link on the sign-in form (or by visiting `/recover` directly):

1. The member enters their account email. The response is always the same, so the
   form can't be used to check whether an address has an account.
2. If the address belongs to a member, they receive an email with a reset link to
   your site. The link **works once** and **expires after one hour** — and completing
   a reset invalidates any other outstanding links.
3. The member sets a new password and signs in with it. Suspended members don't
   receive reset emails.

## Gate a screen

1. Open the screen you want to protect.
2. Mark it **members-only**.
3. Publish. Only signed-in members can now view it; everyone else is prompted to sign in.

## Manage your members

The site's **Users** page lists everyone who signed up on your published site —
searchable and paged, newest first. Click a member to open their detail drawer:

- **Profile** — email, display name, join date, and saved addresses.
- **Order history** — the member's payment records, newest first: order number,
  status, total, and date, plus the Stripe payment reference and any refunded
  amount. Order history is visible to site admins and editors.
- **Subscriptions** — active and past storefront subscriptions with their
  renewal date.
- **Lifetime purchases** — everything the member actually paid: charged order
  totals minus refunds (pending and cancelled orders don't count).

### Suspend or reactivate a member

From the drawer you can **suspend** a member (with a confirmation). A suspended
member:

- can no longer **sign in** on your published site — they see a clear
  "account suspended" message;
- is **signed out** the next time their account page loads;
- keeps all orders, subscriptions, and history — nothing is deleted.

**Reactivate** restores access with the member's existing password. The member
list shows each account's Active/Suspended status at a glance.

## Tips

- Combine members-only screens with [email campaigns](../../marketing-and-automation/email-campaigns/overview.md) to
  nurture your member base.
- For one-off protection without accounts, use a
  [per-screen password](../../building-sites/site-protection/overview.md) instead.
