# Build a mega menu with hover interactions

A **mega menu** is the wide, multi-column panel that drops down from a nav
item on big marketing sites. In this walkthrough you'll add one to your
header, fill it with columns of links, and wire it to **open on hover** —
all in the Besigner, without writing any CSS or JavaScript.

You can see the finished result on our demo site: hover **Explore** in the
header of [northwind-coffee.aglyn.app](https://northwind-coffee.aglyn.app)
and a three-column panel (Coffee / Learn / Get in touch) drops open.

:::info Plan availability
**Every plan, including Free.** A mega menu and its open/close behavior are
**basic interactions** — pure in-page choreography with no server cost, so
they're never gated. Only the powerful automation steps (analytics,
overlays, custom JS, server actions) require Pro+. See
[interactions](../building-sites/besigner/interactions-and-custom-html.md#plan-availability).
:::

## What you'll build

- A **Mega Menu** nav item with a wide panel.
- Three **columns** of screen links inside the panel.
- A **hover interaction** so the panel opens when a visitor points at the
  nav item — and closes itself when they move away.

Put the menu in your **layout** (not a single screen) so it shows on every
page. Open your **Main Layout** in the Besigner to follow along; if you
don't have a layout yet, see
[Screens & layouts](../building-sites/screens-and-layouts/overview.md#layouts).

## 1. Insert the Mega Menu

1. In the Besigner, select your header's nav bar (the **App Bar** or its
   **Toolbar**) so the new element lands inside it.
2. Open **Add Element** and expand the **Navigation** group.
3. Insert **Mega Menu**. It arrives as a nav item labelled *Menu* with a
   starter panel of three link columns.

On the canvas the menu shows **just its trigger** — that's how it renders
on the live site until a visitor interacts. Select the Mega Menu (or
anything inside it) and the panel **expands in place** so you can edit its
contents; click elsewhere and it collapses again.

:::tip Set the label
With the Mega Menu selected, set its **Label** in the inspector (for the
demo it's *Explore*). Use the **Panel width** attribute to choose *Fit
content*, *Wide* (720px), or *Full width*.

## 2. Build the columns

The panel is an ordinary canvas slot, so you compose it like any other
section:

1. The starter preset gives you three **Stacks** side by side — one per
   column. Select a column and set a heading (e.g. *Coffee*, *Learn*, *Get
   in touch*).
2. Inside each column, drop **Screen Link** elements from the
   **Navigation** group and point each at a screen. Screen links store the
   **screen id**, not the URL, so renaming or re-slugging a page never
   breaks the menu.
3. Add as many columns, links, images, or promo cards as you like — a mega
   menu panel takes any content.

## 3. Make it open on hover

Out of the box, **clicking** the nav item already toggles the panel — no
setup. To add the classic hover behavior:

1. Select the **Mega Menu** element itself.
2. In the inspector, open **Add interaction**.
3. Set the **Trigger** to **When hovered**.
4. Add the action **Open a menu**. Leave the target empty — it defaults to
   the element you're editing.
5. Leave **Frequency** on **Every time** (the default) so the menu keeps
   working on every hover, not just once.
6. **Save**. The interaction is enabled immediately and appears in the
   element's Interactions list with edit, enable/disable, and remove
   controls.

![The Add interaction dialog with When hovered selected and an Open a menu action](/img/guides/mega-menu-interaction-dialog.png)

That's the whole wiring. A menu opened by hover **closes itself** when the
pointer leaves the nav item and its panel, with a short grace period so the
pointer can travel between the two — you don't need a separate *When hover
ends* interaction.

:::tip Pick the target by clicking
Any interaction that targets an element (open a menu, show/hide, open a
drawer) lets you **pick the target by clicking it on the canvas** and
confirming — no CSS selectors to write. A "define a custom selector" option
is there as a secondary escape hatch.
:::

## 4. Add a mobile drawer (optional)

A wide hover panel is a desktop pattern. For small screens, pair it with a
slide-in drawer:

1. Insert **Mobile Nav** (Navigation group) into your toolbar. You get a
   **Menu Button** (hidden on desktop), an inline link row (hidden on
   mobile), and a **Drawer** already wired to the button — clicking the
   button toggles the drawer with **zero configuration**.
2. Swap the drawer's placeholder links for your screens, and design the
   drawer panel however you like — it's a normal canvas slot.
3. Under **Styles → Visibility**, confirm the mega menu's nav cluster is
   **hidden on mobile** and the menu button is **hidden on desktop**.

See [menus & navigation](../building-sites/menus-and-navigation/overview.md)
for the full element reference.

## 5. Test and publish

1. Use **Test** in the interaction dialog to confirm the open/close
   behavior against the canvas.
2. Toggle the artboard **device preview** and **light/dark scheme** to
   check the panel at different sizes.
3. Click **Publish**.

Open your live site and hover the nav item — the panel drops open, and
moving the pointer away closes it.

## How it works under the hood

You never touch selectors or state, but here's the model:

- Every menu and drawer renders **closed on the live site** and listens on
  a small **command bus** keyed by its node id.
- An **Open a menu** step dispatches an *open* command to that bus; the
  menu element receives it and expands. Click-toggle, the hover
  interaction, and any other element that opens the menu all speak the same
  bus, so they compose without conflicting.
- Hover-opened menus track the pointer and dispatch their own *close* when
  it leaves — which is why you only author the open.

Because it's all in-page DOM choreography, it runs on **every plan** and is
never metered.

## Troubleshooting

- **The panel is always open in the editor.** That's expected — selecting
  the menu or its contents expands it so you can edit. It renders closed on
  the published site. Click empty canvas to collapse it.
- **Hover does nothing on the live site.** Confirm the interaction's
  **Trigger** is *When hovered*, the action is *Open a menu*, and the
  interaction is **enabled** (green switch on the Interactions list).
  Confirm you published after adding it.
- **The menu opens but won't close.** Make sure you used *Open a menu*
  (which auto-closes on pointer leave), not *Show an element* (which needs
  a matching *When hover ends → Hide* interaction).
