# Datasets & schema deep-dive

This guide goes one level below the
[datasets overview](../content-and-data/datasets/overview.md): how the typed
model actually works, what the limits are, and every path data takes in and
out of a dataset.

<!-- regenerate: node tools/e2e/capture-docs-shots.mjs -->

## Display names vs field ids

A dataset field has two names, and the distinction matters everywhere:

- The **display name** is what you type in the schema dialog and what table
  headers and record editors show. Rename it freely.
- The **reference id** is the stable key. It **auto-fills from the display
  name** when you create the field (`Visit frequency` → `visit_frequency`), and
  the schema dialog lets you **edit it** right there to set your own — for
  example a short, code-friendly key that differs from the label. Once the field
  is created the id is **fixed** and never changes. Records store values keyed by
  reference id — it's the key you use in `{{item.reference_id}}` bindings and
  what a form field's **Maps to schema field** picker stores.

The schema dialog shows both — each field row reads `Display name · fieldId`.
The Reference ID input sits directly under Display name in the field editor; it
follows the name as you type until you edit it, then keeps your value.
The dataset itself likewise has a **Singular name** and a **Plural name**; the
plural is the dataset's display name — the label its entry shows in
"[Write to dataset](build-and-publish-a-survey.md#5-point-the-form-at-the-dataset)"
and repeatable pickers (which store the dataset's id underneath, so renames
never break the bindings).

## Naming & describing fields

Open the schema dialog and **Edit** a field to change how it presents:

- **Display name** — rename it freely, any time. The field id underneath never
  changes, so `{{item.fieldId}}` bindings, form field mappings, and stored
  records are all unaffected by a rename.
- **Description** — a free-form note on what the field is for. When set, it
  follows the field around the console:
  - the schema dialog's field list shows it under the `Display name · fieldId`
    line,
  - the records table shows it as a tooltip on the column header,
  - the record editor shows it as the input's helper text (a validation error
    takes its place while present).

Both are trimmed on save, and a blank description is dropped rather than
stored. Descriptions are console-facing documentation only — they never render
on the published site.

## The typed model

A dataset's **model** is a map of field definitions plus a display order.
Each field definition carries its type, whether it's **Required**, an optional
**Description** and **Default value**, validation (regex pattern, min/max
length, an enum of **Options**), and — for reference fields — the target
dataset and delete behavior.

The types you can author:

| Type | Holds |
| --- | --- |
| **Text** | Strings; optionally pattern-, length-, or enum-constrained |
| **Boolean** | true / false |
| **Integer** | Whole numbers |
| **Number** | Floating-point numbers |
| **Date & time** | Timestamps |
| **Coordinates** | Latitude / longitude pairs |
| **List** | Ordered arrays |
| **Reference** | A link to a record in another dataset — see [relations](../content-and-data/datasets/relations.md) |

Plugins can register **custom field types**, which appear in the type picker
suffixed with the plugin id. Records are validated and coerced against the
model on every server-side write.

:::info Legacy datasets
Datasets created before typed models (a flat comma-separated field list) still
work: the runtime derives an *effective model* where every column is an
optional text field whose id equals the column name. Open the schema dialog
and re-type the fields to upgrade — ids are preserved.
:::

Reference fields configure what happens **when a referenced document is
deleted**: *Clear the reference* (default) or *Block the delete*. Tick
*Allow multiple* for many-to-many relations.

## Record quotas per plan

Dataset counts and records per dataset are entitlements of your organization's
plan:

| Plan | Datasets | Records per dataset |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Free | — (no data store) | — |
| Starter | 3 | 1,000 |
| Pro | 15 | 10,000 |
| Business | 100 | 100,000 |
| Advanced | 500 | 1,000,000 |

- Creating datasets on Free is rejected with *"Datasets require a Starter plan
  or higher."*
- Hitting the record cap surfaces *"Record limit reached — see Billing to
  upgrade"* in the console, and imports that would overflow are refused with
  the exact slot math.
- **Form submissions never fail on quota** — if the dataset is full the record
  write is skipped silently, but the inbox copy is always kept.
- [Add-ons](../workspace-and-billing/billing-and-plans/add-ons.md) raise the
  dataset count beyond the base allowance, up to a hard per-plan ceiling.

## Import & export

The Data page round-trips **CSV and JSON**:

- **Export** — the **CSV** and **JSON** toolbar buttons download the loaded
  records with one column per model field.
- **Import** — the **Import records** dialog takes pasted **CSV (with a header
  row) or a JSON array**. Columns match by field id first, then
  case-insensitively by display name; rows are validated against the model on
  the way in.
- **Upsert** — pick a **Match on field (upsert)** key (say, an email field) and
  matching rows update records in place instead of appending duplicates. Only
  genuinely new rows count against the record quota.

See [import & export](../content-and-data/datasets/import-export.md) for
round-trip tips.

## Repeatables

Containers (like a Stack) have a **Repeat over dataset** property. Set it and
the container's children become an **item template**, rendered once per record
on the published site:

1. Select the container and set **Repeat over dataset** to your dataset
   (stored by id, so renames never break it).
2. Inside the children, reference record values with `{{item.fieldId}}` —
   e.g. `{{item.name}}`, `{{item.price}}`.
3. Reference fields support one hop: `{{item.author.name}}` resolves the
   referenced record's field.
4. Optionally set a **Repeat limit**, a **Repeat filter**
   (`price <= 20`, operators `==`, `!=`, `>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=`, `contains`),
   and a **Repeat sort** (`price desc`).

The canvas doesn't expand rows while designing — it shows a repeat notice on
the container ("children render once per record on the live site") so you
design a single template. Up to 100 records render per repeatable.

## Everything that writes records

| Writer | How it behaves |
| --- | --- |
| **Console** — **Add record** / record editor | Typed inputs per field; validated and quota-checked. |
| **Console** — **Import records** | Bulk CSV/JSON with validation, upsert, and quota math. |
| **Forms** — the Form element's **Write to dataset** | Appends on each submission. The dataset is bound by id (a dropdown; legacy forms still match by name) and each form field can map to a schema field by id via **Maps to schema field**, with name-matching as the fallback — so renames never lose data. Best-effort (quota-full submissions keep only the inbox copy). See the [survey guide](build-and-publish-a-survey.md). |
| **Automations** — the **Write to a dataset** step | Appends a record from a workflow/action run. |
| **Automations** — the **Update a dataset record** step | Updates a matching record (by email) or appends when none matches. |

Automation steps live in the **Do** list of an action — see
[workflows & actions](../marketing-and-automation/workflows-and-actions/overview.md).
