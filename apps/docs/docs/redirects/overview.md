# Redirects

The **redirect manager** sends old or alternate URLs to the right place — essential when you
rename screens or migrate a site.

:::info Plan availability
**Paid**. The redirect manager is a paid feature.

## Manage redirects

- Create, edit, and delete redirect rules from the **redirect manager** page.
- Rules are **validated** on save, with **chain-loop** and **screen-collision** checks so a
  redirect can't send visitors in circles or shadow a real screen.
- The tenant enforces redirect rules during route resolution.

## Metrics

Each rule tracks **hit metrics** (sampled), so you can see which redirects are actually
used and prune the ones that aren't.

Examples for common migration patterns are on the way.
