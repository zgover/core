# Glossary & naming conventions

Aglyn's vocabulary grew through a couple of migrations, so several words
name the same thing at different layers. This page is the canonical map
(codified in AGL-443).

## The hierarchy

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  Org["Organization (org)<br/>orgs/{orgId} — billing, members, plugins"]
  Org --> H1["Host (site)<br/>hosts/{hostId}"]
  Org --> H2["Host (site)<br/>hosts/{hostId}"]
  H1 --> S1["Screens, layouts, media, content"]
  H2 --> S2["Screens, layouts, media, content"]
```

## Organization (org)

**The entity.** One subscription, one members roster (owner / admin /
editor / viewer), one isolation boundary in Firestore (`orgs/{orgId}`),
one plugin switchboard (`enabledPlugins`), org-scoped shared data
(datasets, contacts, media, installs). Every current API, type, and
permission is org-named: `AglynOrganization`, `resolveOrgPermissions`,
`getOrgForHost`, the console's `/org/*` section.

**Rule: new code that touches the entity says `org`.**

## Workspace

**The same entity, in the user's language.** "Your workspace" is what we
call an organization in UI copy and user docs — Slack-style, including
the `{slug}.aglyn.io` workspace subdomain. It intentionally never names a
collection or a type.

**Rule: `workspace` appears in UI copy and docs only, never in code
identifiers.**

## Tenant

Two meanings — this is the word to be careful with:

1. **The published-site runtime** (current, correct use): `apps/tenant`
   is the app that renders customers' live sites, and the shared
   `@aglyn/tenant-*` libraries serve that side of the platform.
   "Multi-tenant" in architecture prose uses this sense: the org is the
   tenancy boundary.
2. **A historic alias for the org's billing doc** (now removed): before
   the organizations migration, billing lived at `tenants/{uid}`. The
   collection is retired and, as of AGL-444, so are the alias
   *identifiers* — `AglynTenant` is now `AglynOrgBilling`,
   `useCurrentTenant()` is `useCurrentOrg()` (returning `org`), the
   plugin-page `tenant` prop is `org`, and the `Tenant*`
   permission/entitlement types are `Org*`. The persisted *strings* went
   in AGL-445, while the platform was still pre-launch: Stripe billing
   metadata is keyed `orgId`, host docs carry only `orgId`/`memberRoles`,
   and the `users.{uid}.tenants` map is gone. No tenant-spelled data
   remains to migrate.

**Rule: "tenant" means the site runtime, full stop. Code that means the
entity says `org` and types it `AglynOrgBilling`.**

## Tenant vs. host — not the same thing

These are the two most-confused terms because both relate to published
sites:

- A **host** is *one site*: `hosts/{hostId}`, with its own domain or
  subdomain, screens, media, and member-role projection. An organization
  owns many hosts ("3 of 15 sites"). In UI copy a host is called a
  **site**.
- The **tenant app** is the *runtime that serves every host*: one
  Next.js deployment that resolves the incoming hostname to a host doc
  (`hostIndex`), loads that host's org, and renders its published
  screens.

So: an org (workspace) owns hosts (sites); the tenant app serves them.
A request to `bakery.example.com` is resolved to a **host**, whose
**org** decides plugins/entitlements, rendered by the **tenant** app.

## Quick reference

| Term | Layer | Names in code | Use for new work |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Organization / org | Data model, APIs, permissions | `orgs/{orgId}`, `AglynOrganization`, `resolveOrg*` | ✅ the entity |
| Workspace | UX / docs | — (copy only) | ✅ user-facing copy |
| Tenant (runtime) | Published-site side | `apps/tenant`, `@aglyn/tenant-*` | ✅ that side of the platform |
| Tenant (billing alias) | Removed (AGL-444/445) | none — identifiers and persisted strings are both gone | ❌ don't reintroduce |
| Host / site | One published site | `hosts/{hostId}`, `AglynHost` | ✅ `host` in code, "site" in copy |
