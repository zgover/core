# What's New — July 2026

A huge wave of features shipped over the last few days. Here's the tour, grouped by area.
Each links into its section for the how-to.

## In-console help (newest)

- **[Documentation from the console](getting-started/console-tour.md#the-app-bar)** —
  the account menu now has a **Documentation** entry that opens this site in a
  new tab, and feature pages grew a small **?** icon next to their titles: hover
  for a one-line summary, click through for the full docs page.
- **[Help everywhere](getting-started/console-tour.md#in-context-help)** — the
  same **?** affordance now covers cards, form fields, table headers, the
  staff console, and the Besigner's style and attribute panels, each
  deep-linking to the exact docs section it explains.

## Nav menu system

- **[Dropdown Panel preset](building-sites/menus-and-navigation/overview.md#the-dropdown-panel-preset)** —
  a primitive-built hover panel (Stack + Button + hidden panel) that inserts
  with its hover choreography **pre-wired as editable interactions**: show on
  hover with Esc/outside-click dismissal, hide on leave with a 250ms grace
  delay. Show/hide steps themselves gained **Delay** and **Close on
  Esc / outside click** options in the interaction builder.
- **[Menus & navigation](building-sites/menus-and-navigation/overview.md)** — a
  **Dropdown Menu**, a **Mega Menu** with a free-form wide panel, a slide-in
  **Drawer** with a **Menu Button**, and a one-insert **Mobile Nav** preset.
  Every menu click-toggles out of the box; hover opening (and anything
  fancier) is authored as an interaction. Interactions gained hover
  enter/leave triggers, a repeatable *every time* frequency, element
  **show/hide** actions with a canvas element picker, and **menu** and
  **drawer open/close** actions; the styles panel gained a per-device-band
  **Visibility** control.

## Designed content collections

- **[First-class blog pages](building-sites/site-templates/build-a-blog.md)** — collection
  list and entry routes render through your site theme and shared layout. Pick a
  **List template screen** and an **Entry template screen** per collection in
  **Content**, drop the new **Collection Entries** block (repeats title, date,
  excerpt, Read more per published entry — works on any screen via its
  collection-slug attribute), and render markdown with the themed **Entry
  Body** block. With no template set, the built-in pages still compose inside
  your theme and default layout.

## Self-serve add-ons

- **[Add-ons](workspace-and-billing/billing-and-plans/add-ons.md)** — buy manager and
  member seats, extra datasets, extra sites, POS registers, and the Event Calendar
  straight from **Billing → Add-ons**: prorated previews before every change, hard caps
  where your plan tops out, and quantities that re-price automatically on plan switches.
  No more asking support to enable an add-on.

## Designer & email wave

- **[Responsive styling](building-sites/besigner/responsive-styling.md)** — the artboard
  preview mode now scopes style edits per breakpoint (XS–XL), the box
  stylers are fully interactive with side/axis/all fan-out and units, and
  every element takes custom classes plus a CSS builder (builder / raw
  CSS / raw JSS) on its `sx`.
- **[Designed emails](marketing-and-automation/email-campaigns/designed-emails.md)** — build
  campaign emails in the besigner with email-safe blocks and merge
  tokens; campaigns pick templates by id and support test sends.
- **Rename-safe references everywhere** — products, collections,
  categories, datasets, and screens are picked from lists and stored by
  id; the reference-health audit flags anything dangling.
- **Console reorganization** — site users and analytics get their own
  sections, the dashboard gains commerce and campaign glance widgets, and
  the Products/Marketing/Workflows hubs are tabbed with `?tab=` deep
  links. Notifications + profile live under a personal Manage area.
- **[Redirects v2](building-sites/redirects/overview.md)** — prefix and regex match
  modes with capture substitution (`$1`), priority ordering, and an
  inline tester.
- **Org & team v2** — organization logo + contact details, a team member
  detail page with role/title editing and per-member activity, personal
  community profiles, and profile images for every user.
- **Staff console v3** — impersonate a user or an org's owner (audited,
  bannered), edit orgs and user identities directly, and paginated,
  card-styled admin lists.

## Ecommerce platform

The biggest wave yet turns every Aglyn site into a full store, competitive
with Shopify and Squarespace:

- **[Product catalog](commerce-and-bookings/commerce/catalog.md)** — variants and options,
  categories, tags, smart collections, Shopify-compatible CSV import.
- **Storefront blocks** — product grids with facets, product pages with
  variant pickers, cart drawer + checkout with wallets, customer accounts,
  wishlists, newsletter capture. All designable in the besigner.
- **Digital goods** — secure downloads with automatic update re-delivery,
  license keys, subscription products, members-only content and video.
- **[POS & reservations](commerce-and-bookings/commerce/pos-and-reservations.md)** — a console
  register (cash, QR card, room folios) and date-range stays with deposits.
- **Growth tools** — discounts engine, gift cards, abandoned-cart recovery,
  verified reviews, related products, back-in-stock alerts, and a commerce
  analytics dashboard.
- **[New pricing](workspace-and-billing/billing-and-plans/overview.md)** — Starter $16, Pro $39,
  Business $99, and the new Advanced $299 (annual), with platform fees that
  drop to 0% as you upgrade. Existing subscribers keep their current price
  until they change plans.

## Latest polish wave

The newest round tightened every marketing, billing, and operations loop:

- **[Overlays](marketing-and-automation/marketing-overlays/overview.md)** now track per-overlay views, clicks,
  and dismissals — mirrored into your GA property as `aglyn_overlay` events.
- **[Campaigns](marketing-and-automation/email-campaigns/overview.md)** gained `{{firstName|there}}`-style merge
  tags and **scheduled sends** with cancelation.
- **[Experiments](marketing-and-automation/email-campaigns/overview.md#experiments)** can end on a date or
  **auto-declare a winner** at your chosen confidence level, and exposures/conversions
  mirror into GA as `aglyn_experiment` events.
- **[Automations](marketing-and-automation/workflows-and-actions/actions-builder.md)** picked up frequency
  controls: once per session, once per visitor, or a cooldown window.
- **[Workflows](marketing-and-automation/workflows-and-actions/build-a-workflow.md)** log every run with outcome
  and duration; the Logic page's **Reference health** card flags automations pointing at
  deleted workflows, datasets, or functions.
- **[Dataset imports](content-and-data/datasets/import-export.md)** can **upsert on a key field** instead
  of appending duplicates.
- **[Billing](workspace-and-billing/billing-and-plans/overview.md)** added the Stripe **Billing Portal** for
  payment methods, a past-due banner during retry windows, and usage-threshold
  notifications to org admins.
- The **Marketing hub** opens with an at-a-glance rollup of live overlays, email
  engagement, and experiment states; commerce orders now notify site managers in-app.
