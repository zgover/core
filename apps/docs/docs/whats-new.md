# What's New — July 2026

A huge wave of features shipped over the last few days. Here's the tour, grouped by area.
Each links into its section for the how-to.

## Latest polish wave

The newest round tightened every marketing, billing, and operations loop:

- **[Overlays](marketing-overlays/overview.md)** now track per-overlay views, clicks,
  and dismissals — mirrored into your GA property as `aglyn_overlay` events.
- **[Campaigns](email-campaigns/overview.md)** gained `{{firstName|there}}`-style merge
  tags and **scheduled sends** with cancelation.
- **[Experiments](email-campaigns/overview.md#experiments)** can end on a date or
  **auto-declare a winner** at your chosen confidence level, and exposures/conversions
  mirror into GA as `aglyn_experiment` events.
- **[Automations](workflows-and-actions/actions-builder.md)** picked up frequency
  controls: once per session, once per visitor, or a cooldown window.
- **[Workflows](workflows-and-actions/build-a-workflow.md)** log every run with outcome
  and duration; the Logic page's **Reference health** card flags automations pointing at
  deleted workflows, datasets, or functions.
- **[Dataset imports](datasets/import-export.md)** can **upsert on a key field** instead
  of appending duplicates.
- **[Billing](billing-and-plans/overview.md)** added the Stripe **Billing Portal** for
  payment methods, a past-due banner during retry windows, and usage-threshold
  notifications to org admins.
- The **Marketing hub** opens with an at-a-glance rollup of live overlays, email
  engagement, and experiment states; commerce orders now notify site managers in-app.

## Build & design

- **[The Besigner](besigner/overview.md)** — multi-select across hierarchy and canvas,
  whole-selection multi-drag, reliable reparenting with placement markers, inline and basic
  rich-text editing, and clearer "why this drop was rejected" messaging.
- **[Screens & layouts](screens-and-layouts/overview.md)** — hierarchical routing with
  cascading slug rewrites, shared **layouts** with slots, reusable components, and **named
  versions with scheduled publishing**.
- **[Theme builder](theme-builder/overview.md)** — site theme editor with live preview and
  light/dark schemes, supplied to the canvas so previews match the live site.
- **[Templates, blocks & content](site-templates/overview.md)** — starter template gallery,
  save-site-as-template, a section & block library, and a blog with collections and RSS.

## Data

- **[Datasets & dynamic content](datasets/overview.md)** — typed model builder, typed
  document editor, **relations** (including many-to-many), a query layer, repeatable
  components, and CSV/JSON round-tripping.
- **[Bindings, variables & functions](bindings/overview.md)** — **rename-safe id tokens**,
  a picker-first insert experience, a no-code function builder, and a where-used safety scan.
- **[Site search](site-search/overview.md)** — search across pages and dataset records.

## Media

- **[Media library & CDN](media/overview.md)** — folder organization with drag-and-drop,
  metadata and bulk edit, image transforms, large video uploads, and **CDN delivery** with
  WebP variants (paid).

## Grow

- **[Forms & lead capture](forms/overview.md)** — form components, an inbox reader, and
  dataset-backed submissions.
- **[Contacts CRM](contacts/overview.md)** — unified ingestion from forms, members, orders,
  and bookings, with tags, notes, CSV export, and **segments**.
- **[Email campaigns](email-campaigns/overview.md)** — audiences, tiered send caps, and
  unsubscribe handling.
- **[Marketing overlays](marketing-overlays/overview.md)** — a site-wide announcement bar and
  **promotional popups v2** with triggers, capping, scheduling, email capture, and metrics.

## Sell

- **[Commerce](commerce/overview.md)** — starter selling plus commerce v2 (receipts,
  inventory, coupon codes) and an orders page with filters and CSV export.
- **[Bookings & scheduling](bookings/overview.md)** — services, availability, a booking
  widget, Stripe payments with slot holds, and reminder emails.

## Reach & measure

- **[SEO toolkit](seo/overview.md)** — per-screen SEO, sitemap/robots, JSON-LD, and Open
  Graph/Twitter cards.
- **[Analytics](analytics/overview.md)** — pageview beacon, insights (referrers, devices,
  ranges), and **per-screen traffic** (Pro+).
- **[Multilingual](multilingual/overview.md)** — locale variants, hreflang, and a language
  switcher (v1).

## Extend & automate

- **[Plugins & marketplace](plugins/overview.md)** — a plugin registry with install/upgrade,
  a sandboxed runtime, per-plugin config, a network bridge, and marketplace monetization.
- **[Workflows, actions & webhooks](workflows-and-actions/overview.md)** — event-to-action
  automation, workflows on site events, and outbound/inbound webhooks.

  Section.

  Slack-style workspace subdomains
  ([architecture](staff-console/architecture-multi-tenancy.md)).
