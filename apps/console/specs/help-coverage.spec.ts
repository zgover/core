/**
 * Coverage guard for the contextual help system (AGL-605). Keeps "help
 * everywhere applicable" (AGL-599..601) durable: a new feature page or card
 * that ships without a `help` affordance fails here unless it is explicitly
 * listed as an intentional exception below.
 *
 * The checks are deliberately file-level heuristics (not an AST walk): a file
 * that renders the surface must also reference `help=` somewhere, or be
 * allowlisted. That catches the real risk — a whole new surface added with no
 * help at all — which is exactly how the screen detail page was missed
 * (AGL-604). Partial coverage within an already-help-using file is out of
 * scope for this guard.
