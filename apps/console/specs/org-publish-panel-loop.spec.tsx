/**
 * Does changing the publish panel's artifact kind loop? (AGL-788)
 *
 * The console dev server throws "Maximum update depth exceeded" from this
 * select's onChange, and AGL-785 closed the same symptom once already.
 *
 * **What this establishes: the panel itself is clean.** It drives the exact dev
 * repro (component <-> layout, five rounds) both with and without StrictMode.
 * React's development build — which jest uses — enforces the update-depth limit
 * in both cases, so a render loop originating in this component would throw.
 * Neither does.
 *
 * **What it does NOT establish: that the dev-server symptom is benign.** Two
 * gaps, both deliberate and both worth knowing before trusting a green run
 * here:
 *
 * 1. The panel is rendered STANDALONE. On the real page it lives inside
 *    HubTabs, and AGL-785 diagnosed the loop as a diffuse HubTabs keepMounted
 *    settling-window race — so the suspected culprit isn't even in this tree.
 * 2. The Firestore hooks are mocked to resolve synchronously. The real
 *    `useFirestoreCollection` runs `setData([])` inside an effect before an
 *    `onSnapshot` subscription settles, which is the asynchronous window
 *    AGL-785 pointed at.
 *
 * So: a regression guard for a loop already "fixed" twice, and evidence that
 * this panel is not the origin. Settling AGL-788 still needs the production
 * runtime, or a harness that mounts the whole marketplace page.
