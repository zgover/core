/**
 * Console plugin surfaces (AGL-394). Feature plugins declare their console
 * nav items, pages, and dashboard cards through the ConsoleExtension
 * registry; importing this module at `_app` load populates the registry
 * before any nav renders. The shell (host-nav-tabs + the generic
 * `[hostId]/[pluginSlug]` route) reads the registry, so a plugin extends
 * the console — menu items AND pages — without editing core app files.
 *
 * Each entry registers only the console half (nav + lazy page), never the
 * besigner canvas bundle, so this stays out of the general console bundle.
 * The canvas bundles still register per-editor in the besigner/preview
 * pages via `register*Plugin()`.
