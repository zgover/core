 * activity route and — in spirit — the client hook.
 *
 * Why the server holds this: `useIdleLogout` retires the SHARED
 * cross-subdomain `__session` cookie on expiry (AGL-236/AGL-464). Deciding
 * "idle" from a single tab's `localStorage`/host-only cookie let one
 * untouched tab sign the user out of every `.aglyn.com` subdomain, because
 * activity on a sibling tab or subdomain was invisible to it. The server is
 * the one place every `.aglyn.com` origin's requests converge, so an
 * HttpOnly parent-domain heartbeat cookie set here is an authoritative,
 * unspoofable "last-seen across the whole session" that a tab must consult
 * before performing that global sign-out.
