 * Resolves the version a site owner should open for one of their site's
 * emails, creating one on first edit (AGL-770). The host-scoped sibling of
 * {@link openSystemEmailVersion}: the template lives at
 * `hosts/{hostId}/emailTemplates/{key}` rather than the staff collection.

 * There is no "new site email" action — the catalog is code, so a template
 * document only exists because somebody pressed Design. The version is written
 * before the pointer, so a crash between the two leaves an orphan version
 * (which nothing reads) rather than a pointer to a missing version (a 404).
