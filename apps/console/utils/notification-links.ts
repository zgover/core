/**
 * Rewrites a stored notification link onto the current URL scheme (AGL-644).
 *
 * A notification's `link` is frozen at write time — `notifyUsers` persists
 * whatever string the emitter passed and never normalizes it. So every
 * notification written before the org-slug migration (AGL-621) and the
 * subdomain migration (AGL-622) still points at a route that no longer
 * exists, and fixing the emitters alone would leave that whole backlog dead.
 * Normalizing when the link is FOLLOWED repairs old and new alike, and keeps
 * working for emitters that haven't been migrated yet.
 *
 * Rewrites, in order:
 * - `/{hostDocId}` or `/{hostDocId}/rest` → `/{orgSlug}/hosts/{subdomain}/rest`
 * - `/org` or `/org/rest`                 → `/{orgSlug}/rest`
 * - `/hosts` (exactly)                    → `/{orgSlug}/hosts`
 *
 * Anything already canonical, user-scoped (`/manage/...`), staff (`/admin/...`)
 * or absolute is returned untouched. Every rewrite is gated on having the
 * context it needs, so an unresolvable link degrades to its stored value
 * rather than to a wrong destination.
 *
 * The host rewrite is keyed on the notification's own `hostId` rather than
 * guessing from the path shape, so it can never mistake a real first segment
 * for a doc id.
