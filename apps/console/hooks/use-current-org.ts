 * Subscribes with a raw `onSnapshot` (with its own retry) rather than
 * reactfire's `useFirestoreDocData` — that hook's cached Observable is a

 * transient `permission-denied` this read can hit right after sign-in, when
 * `useUser()` reports a signed-in user a beat before Firestore's own
 * credential provider has attached that user's ID token (AGL-216).
