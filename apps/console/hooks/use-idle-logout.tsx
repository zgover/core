 * becomes visible again, so a laptop waking from sleep expires immediately
 * rather than waiting a full tick.
 *
 * Because that sign-out is GLOBAL — it retires the cross-subdomain `__session`
 * cookie for every `.aglyn.com` tab — a tab that looks idle locally must first
 * confirm the WHOLE session is idle with the server before pulling the trigger
 * (AGL-697). A sibling tab or subdomain the local store can't see may still be
 * active; only when no origin has beaten for the timeout window does the
 * session genuinely expire, preserving AGL-464's intent.
