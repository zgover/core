/**
 * Bridges a Next.js `<Link>`'s real navigation transition state
 * (`useLinkStatus`, Next 15.3+/16) to the global loading overlay.
 *
 * Rendered as a child of every `<Link>` (via {@link NextLink}). `useLinkStatus`
 * reads the *enclosing* link's own status context, so only the clicked link's
 * reporter goes `pending` — exactly one overlay is queued per navigation, and
 * it stays queued until the destination route is genuinely ready (through slow
 * dev compiles / RSC fetches).
 *
 * This replaces the old `usePathname`/`useSearchParams` heuristic, which
 * settled the overlay on URL *commit* — before a slow segment had finished
 * fetching/compiling — so the modal flashed away while the user was still
 * waiting for the real 200.
 *
 * `useLoading()` returns a no-op context when no `LoadingProvider` sits above
 * it, so this is safe for links rendered outside an app shell.
