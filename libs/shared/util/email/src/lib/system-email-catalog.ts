 * the Firebase console. **A besigner template cannot affect these at all**
 * until the send is taken over (AGL-751). They are listed so staff can see
 * the full set of mail the product sends and where each one is controlled;
 * the UI must present them as non-editable rather than offering an editor
 * that silently does nothing.
