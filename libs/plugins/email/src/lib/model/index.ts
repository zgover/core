/**
 * Email rendering model (AGL-412): besigner-built email HTML rendering + merge tags, relocated from core app-utils.
 * Context-free — importable by client components, /server handlers, and
 * other plugins/apps via `@aglyn/plugins-email/model`.
 */
// The renderer and merge-tag helpers moved to `@aglyn/shared-util-email`
// (AGL-750): they are pure functions over a node map with no imports at all,
// and the console's own API routes need them to render system email
// templates. Apps are forbidden to import feature plugins (the `scope:app`
// → `aglyn:addons` boundary), so leaving them here made them unreachable
// from exactly the code that has to send the mail.
//
// Re-exported so `@aglyn/plugins-email/model` keeps working unchanged.
