/**
 * Billing-webhook extension point (AGL-418): plugins register handlers for
 * the platform Stripe webhook from their `/server` entries — the console's
 * webhook route verifies the signature, syncs the org's plan/subscription
 * (the only core-billing concern), then fans the event out here. Handlers
 * self-select on `type` + `object.metadata.type` exactly as the old inline
 * sections did (commerce orders/carts/drafts/reservations/subscriptions,
 * booking payments, community purchases). Errors PROPAGATE: a throwing
 * handler fails the webhook with a 500 so Stripe redelivers — identical to
 * the pre-extraction behavior, and every section is idempotent by doc key.
