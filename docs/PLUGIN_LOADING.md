# Plugin loading (AGL-415..420)

How plugins reach the running apps: the manifest pipeline, the org
switchboard, and the three trust tiers. The companion authoring guide is
`apps/docs/docs/plugins/building-feature-plugins.md`; the sandboxed-origin
reference is `tools/plugin-loader/README.md`; the competitive gap analysis
and v2 roadmap live in `docs/PLUGIN_PLATFORM_GAPS.md`.

## The rule

**Nothing outside `libs/plugins/*` imports `@aglyn/plugins-*`.** Enforced
by the nx boundary rule (`scope:app` may not depend on `aglyn:addons`,
`eslint.config.mjs`). Apps reach plugins only through:

1. **Generated loader manifests** — `plugins.config.json` at the repo root
   maps plugin id → package → register-fn names per surface (`site`,
   `console`, `tenantApi`, `consoleApi`) and API path prefixes.
   `node tools/scripts/generate-plugin-manifests.mjs` emits the four
   `plugins.{client,server}.generated.ts` files under
   `apps/{console,tenant}` — the ONLY sanctioned plugin references
   (file-scoped eslint-disable).
2. **Core registries** (`libs/aglyn/src/lib/plugin-manager/`) — console
   extensions (nav, pages, widgets, providers), site runtimes, site-page
   hooks (redirect resolvers, page resolvers, enrichers), billing-webhook
   handlers, API routes.

## Per-org enablement

`org.enabledPlugins: string[]` (AGL-416) is the switchboard; absent means
`DEFAULT_ENABLED_PLUGINS` (all first-party), and always-on plugins (`mui`)
are unioned in via `resolveEnabledPlugins(org)`. Managed on the org
settings "Plugins" tab. Surfaces follow the switch:

- **Console**: `ConsolePluginsGate` loads the enabled set's `console`
  surfaces after the org resolves, then renders the shell. Editor pages
  additionally gate on the `site` surfaces (`withSitePlugins`).
- **Published sites**: `load-page-data` resolves the host org's enabled
  set into page props; the catch-all client suspends (SSR included) until
  those `site` surfaces register — the canvas never renders against an
  empty registry.
- **APIs**: the `[...pluginApi]` dispatchers lazy-load every first-party
  `/server` entry once, then gate per request — a disabled plugin's paths
  404 for that workspace.

## Trust tiers for marketplace (remote) plugins

| Tier | Where it runs | Gate |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Sandboxed (default) | Cross-origin `PluginFrame` iframe on the dedicated plugin origin | sha256 pin + manifest CSP + postMessage bridge (AGL-45) |
| Trusted realm | The app realm itself (console and/or site) | Everything below (AGL-420) |
| Remote server handlers | The API dispatcher process | Realm chain + env master switch + per-deploy allowlist |

### The realm trust chain

Every link must hold before a byte executes:

1. **Content pinning** — the workspace's install doc pins
   `{version, sha256}`; artifacts are immutable content-addressed objects
   (`artifacts/{listingId}/{version}/{sha256}.bundle`). The loader hashes
   the fetched bytes and refuses on mismatch.
2. **Staff signature** — granting `trust: 'realm'` (super-staff route
   `POST /api/admin/sign-plugin`, console app) writes an Ed25519
   `signature` over the sha256 hex onto the server-only version doc.
   Loaders verify it with the platform public key and fail closed —
   unsigned, badly signed, or unverifiable (no WebCrypto Ed25519) never
   loads when a key is configured. Server-side loading refuses to run
   without a key at all.
3. **Kill switch** — `revocations/{listingId}` beats a still-present trust
   grant; revoked versions are dropped by the server-side join.
4. **Host ABI, no imports** — bundles are built with
   `tools/plugin-loader/realm/rollup.config.mjs`: `react`,
   `react/jsx-runtime`, and `@aglyn/aglyn` compile to lookups on
   `globalThis.__AGLYN_PLUGIN_HOST__`, which each APP composes from its
   own bundle (`setRealmPluginHost`) so there is exactly one React and one
   registry instance (the blank-canvas invariant).

### Client loading

- **Console**: `ConsolePluginsGate` fetches
  `GET /api/orgs/realm-plugins?orgId=` (server-side join of install pins
  with the staff-only trust grants — clients can't read version docs) and
  `loadRealmPlugins` executes each verified bundle via a blob-URL import,
  calling its exported `register(host)`. Loaded before the shell renders.
- **Sites**: `load-page-data` ships `props.realmPlugins` (same join,
  admin SDK); the catch-all client loads them in a post-hydration effect —
  realm site runtimes are additive, so first paint never waits on a
  marketplace CDN.
- Failures (fetch, sha, signature, execution) are logged and skipped,
  per bundle. A broken remote plugin cannot take a surface down.

### Remote server handlers — the highest-risk switch

Default **OFF everywhere**. All of the following, no exceptions:

- `PLUGIN_REMOTE_SERVER=enabled` — master switch.
- `PLUGIN_REMOTE_SERVER_BUNDLES=listingId@version,...` — explicit
  per-deploy allowlist; installs alone never load server code.
- `PLUGIN_TRUST_PUBLIC_KEY` — required; the signature check is mandatory
  here (no dev-mode skip).
- Version doc must carry `trust: 'realm'`.

The dispatcher writes verified bytes to a private temp file and imports it
(`file://`; node can't import blob URLs), then calls the bundle's
`registerApi()` — handlers register through the same
`registerPluginApiRoute` first-party `/server` entries use, so the
per-request org gate applies to them too.

## Environment variables

| Variable | Runtime | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_PLUGIN_ORIGIN` | client + server | Dedicated plugin origin; serves `/load` (sandbox) and `/artifacts/...` (realm fetches) |
| `PLUGIN_ARTIFACTS_BASE` | server | Optional server-side override of the artifacts base |
| `PLUGIN_ARTIFACTS_BUCKET` | console server | Isolated bucket the publish flow writes bundles to |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_PLUGIN_TRUST_PUBLIC_KEY` | client | Ed25519 public key (base64 raw); when set, client realm loads require valid signatures |
| `PLUGIN_TRUST_PUBLIC_KEY` | server | Same key for the server loader (mandatory there) |
| `PLUGIN_TRUST_PRIVATE_KEY` | console server ONLY | Signing key (base64 PKCS8 DER) for the staff sign-plugin route |
| `PLUGIN_REMOTE_SERVER` | server | `enabled` turns on remote server bundles (default off) |
| `PLUGIN_REMOTE_SERVER_BUNDLES` | server | Comma-separated `listingId@version` allowlist |

Generate the key pair with
`node tools/scripts/generate-plugin-trust-key.mjs`. Rotating the key means
re-signing every granted version, then swapping the public key everywhere.

## Publish → sign → load walkthrough

1. Author builds with the realm rollup template; entry exports
   `register(host)` (client) and/or `registerApi()` (server).
2. Publish through the community pipeline (`community/publish-plugin`) —
   content-addressed upload + version doc with sha256.
3. Workspace installs (pin) the listing; org enables it.
4. Staff review, then `POST /api/admin/sign-plugin`
   `{listingId, version}` (super staff; audited). Revoke trust with
   `{action: 'revoke'}`; hard-kill with a `revocations/{listingId}` doc.
5. Next console visit / site render loads the bundle through the chain
   above. For server handlers, additionally flip the two env switches on
   the specific deployment.
